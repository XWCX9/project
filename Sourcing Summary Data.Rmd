### Data for the trait -> education direction, unrelated individuals
```{r}
un_bmi_instrument <- extract_instruments(outcomes = 'ukb-b-19953')
save(un_bmi_instrument, file = "un_bmi_instrument.RData")
```

```{r}
un_hei_instrument <- extract_instruments(outcomes = 'ieu-a-89')
save(un_hei_instrument, file = "un_hei_instrument.RData")
```

### Downloading the outcome variables:
```{r}
un_ed_bmi_out <- extract_outcome_data(un_bmi_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-a-1239')
save(un_ed_bmi_out, file = "un_ed_bmi_out.RData")
```

```{r}
un_ed_hei_out <- extract_outcome_data(un_hei_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-a-1239')
save(un_ed_hei_out, file = "un_ed_hei_out.RData")
```

# Data for the education -> trait direction, unrelated individuals
### The instrument:
```{r}
un_ed_instrument <- extract_instruments(outcome = 'ieu-a-1239')
save(un_ed_instrument, file = "un_ed_instrument.RData")
```

### outcome data for both traits:
```{r}
un_hei_out <- extract_outcome_data(snps = un_ed_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-a-89')
save(un_hei_out, file = "un_hei_out.RData")
```

```{r}
un_bmi_out <- extract_outcome_data(snps = un_ed_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ukb-b-19953')
save(un_bmi_out, file = "un_bmi_out.RData")
```
# Downloading within-family data for the trait -> education direction of analysis
### The instruments:
```{r}
wf_hei_instrument <- extract_instruments(outcomes = 'ieu-b-4814')
save(wf_hei_instrument, file = "wf_hei_instrument.RData")
```

```{r}
wf_bmi_instrument <- extract_instruments(outcomes = 'ieu-b-4816') # this instrument is very small...
save(wf_bmi_instrument, file = "wf_bmi_instrument.RData")
```

### Extracting the within-family outcome variables for education:
```{r}
wf_hei_ed_out <- extract_outcome_data(wf_hei_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-b-4836') # this doesn't exist
save(wf_hei_ed_out, file = "wf_hei_ed_out.RData") # even though the instrument is significant
```
```{r}
wf_bmi_ed_out <- extract_outcome_data(wf_bmi_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-b-4836') # doesn't produce anything?
head(wf_bmi_ed_out)
save(wf_bmi_ed_out, file = "wf_bmi_ed_out.RData")
```

# Within-family data for the education -> trait direction:
### Extracting the education instrument:
```{r}
wf_rev_ed_instrument <- extract_instruments(outcomes = 'ieu-b-4836')
save(wf_rev_ed_instrument, file = "wf_rev_ed_instrument.RData")
```

### Extracting height and BMI outcome variables (within-family)
```{r}
wf_rev_hei_out <- extract_outcome_data(snps = wf_rev_ed_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-b-4814') # check these
save(wf_rev_hei_out, file = "wf_rev_hei_out.RData")
```

```{r}
wf_rev_bmi_out <- extract_outcome_data(snps = wf_rev_ed_instrument$SNP, outcomes = 'ieu-b-4816') # check these
save(wf_rev_bmi_out, file = "wf_rev_bmi_out.RData")
```
